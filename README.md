# ToolShellFinder: CVE-2025-53770 & CVE-2025-53771 Detection

A PowerShell script for **detecting indicators of compromise (IoCs) for CVE-2025-53770 and CVE-2025-53771** in Microsoft IIS logs.  
This script is hacked together to help DFIR teams, sysadmins, and security professionals identify suspicious activity associated with these vulnerabilities in SharePoint environments.

**Version PS5 is being replaced by version PS7**
- Version PS7 will only work in PowerShell 7 (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.5#zip)

## Background

**CVE-2025-53770** and **CVE-2025-53771** are recently disclosed vulnerabilities affecting Microsoft SharePoint, potentially allowing remote code execution and exploitation via crafted requests to `/ToolPane.aspx`, suspicious uploads, or exploitation of ViewState parameters. Attackers may leave forensic traces in IIS logs.

---

## What This Script Does

- **Recursively scans IIS log files** for patterns linked to exploitation attempts of these CVEs.
- **Identifies and collects matches** for four major sets of IoCs (see below).
- **Outputs a summary table** of detected events and exports detailed results to CSV for further analysis.

---

## Usage

1. **Copy the script to your investigation workstation.**
2. **Set the `$logRoot` path** at the top of the script if your IIS logs are not in `C:\inetpub\logs\LogFiles`.
3. **Run the script in a PowerShell window:**

   ```powershell
   .\toolshellfinder.ps1
   ```
